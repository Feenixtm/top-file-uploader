Server Stuff:

Getting an error when running node script.js in hello-prisma. Probably didn't set up the prisma models correctly or something in the prisma.js file

Order:
    OK public
    OK prisma.schema
    views
    routes (base)
    controllers(base)
    routes (full)
    controllers(full)
    db

Extra:
    utils?
    validators?
    errors?
    config?
